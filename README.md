# Deep Learning with Tensorflow (ResNet50)
An image classification tutorial using the ResNet50 network. As part of transfer learning, we keep the original weights obtained with 'ImageNet' data while tuning the learning rate of Adam optimizer and the number of neuron units and dropout rate in the penultimate dense and dropout layers respectively.
