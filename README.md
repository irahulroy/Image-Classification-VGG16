# Deep Learning with Tensorflow (VGG16)
An image classification tutorial using the VGG16 network. As part of transfer learning, we keep the original weights obtained with 'ImageNet' data while tuning the number of neuron units and dropout rate in the penultimate dense and dropout layers respectively.
